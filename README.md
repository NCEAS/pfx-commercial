Within the folder `portfolio/analysis`, files are run in order according to
the numeric value in their names (`0-...R` then `1-...R`, etc.).

The main hierarchical variance function regression Stan model is in the file
`portfolio/analysis/portfolio-offset.stan`.

The fisheries data used in this study, although confidential, are available
from the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission (<https://www.cfec.state.ak.us/>).
