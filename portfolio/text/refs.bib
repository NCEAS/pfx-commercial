  abstract = {Entropies such as the Shannon\textendash{}Wiener and Gini\textendash{}Simpson indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, S\o{}rensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita\textendash{}Horn index as special cases.},

Insurance mechanisms to mediate economic risks in marine fisheries. \textendash{} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 950\textendash{}959. Uncertainty affects the behaviour of fishers and fisheries regulators in a way that can adversely affect the sustainability of fish stocks, fisheries income, and productivity. In agriculture, there has been a long history of using levy funds and public and private insurance schemes to mediate economic risks to growers resulting from environmental variability and quarantine risks. In the United States, the federal government continues to underwrite funds (collected by contracted private agents) that are used to protect contributors from the effects of extreme weather and pest and disease losses. In Europe, there are examples of industry-based mutual funds to mediate risks from exotic agricultural diseases. In agriculture, insurance mechanisms have been successful in reducing risk-inducing behaviour by contractual compliance to risk-reducing codes of practice. For fisheries, insurance may provide a tool to address some elements of uncertainty in a way that would help both the fishing industry and the regulators achieve objectives of sustainability, income security, and productivity. This paper presents a brief review of insurance in agriculture and capture fisheries and uses a stochastic model to illustrate how insurance funds could protect revenue and encourage increased sustainability of fisheries and improve compliance with and enforcement of fisheries regulation. Although insurance may be a partial solution to unsatisfactory fisheries management and fishing performance, some potential challenges to this novel approach are also discussed.},

  doi = {10.1080/01621459.1987.10478543},
  abstract = {Heteroscedastic regression models are used in fields including economics, engineering, and the biological and physical sciences. Often, the heteroscedasticity is modeled as a function of the covariates or the regression and other structural parameters. Standard asymptotic theory implies that how one estimates the variance function, in particular the structural parameters, has no effect on the first-order properties of the regression parameter estimates; there is evidence, however, both in practice and higher-order theory to suggest that how one estimates the variance function does matter. Further, in some settings, estimation of the variance function is of independent interest or plays an important role in estimation of other quantities. In this article, we study variance function estimation in a unified way, focusing on common methods proposed in the statistical and other literature, to make both general observations and compare different estimation schemes. We show that there are significant differences in both efficiency and robustness for many common methods. We develop a general theory for variance function estimation, focusing on estimation of the structural parameters and including most methods in common use in our development. The general qualitative conclusions are these. First, most variance function estimation procedures can be looked upon as regressions with ``responses'' being transformations of absolute residuals from a preliminary fit or sample standard deviations from replicates at a design point. Our conclusion is that the former is typically more efficient, but not uniformly so. Second, for variance function estimates based on transformations of absolute residuals, we show that efficiency is a monotone function of the efficiency of the fit from which the residuals are formed, at least for symmetric errors. Our conclusion is that one should iterate so that residuals are based on generalized least squares. Finally, robustness issues are of even more importance here than in estimation of a regression function for the mean. The loss of efficiency of the standard method away from the normal distribution is much more rapid than in the regression problem. As an example of the type of model and estimation methods we consider, for observation-covariate pairs (Yi, xi ), one may model the variance as proportional to a power of the mean response, for example,    Where f(xi , $\beta$) is the possibly nonlinear mean function and \texttheta{} is the structural parameter of interest. ``Regression methods'' for estimation of \texttheta{} and $\sigma$ based on residuals  for some regression fit  involve minimizing a sum of squares where some function T of the $\Vert$ri $\Vert$ plays the role of the ``responses'' and an appropriate function of the variance plays the role of the ``regression function.'' For example, if T(x) = x 2, the responses would be ri 2, and the form of the regression function would be suggested by the aproximate fact . One could weight the sum of squares appropriately by considering the approximate variance of ri 2. For the case of replication at each xi , some methods suggest replacing the ri , in the function T by sample standard deviations at each xi . Other functions T, such as T(x) = x or log x have also been proposed.},

  abstract = {Access to most fisheries on the US West Coast was essentially open prior to the mid-1970s when state licenses were first limited for salmon fisheries. Subsequently, licenses to most fisheries on the West Coast have been limited, and the numbers of licenses in many fisheries have been reduced with buy-back programs. More recently, catch share programs, which dedicate exclusive shares of catch to individuals or cooperatives, have been introduced in several sectors of the federally managed Pacific groundfish fishery. As access to fisheries has become more restricted, revenue diversification of West Coast fishing vessels has generally declined. This is a source of concern since diversification has been shown to reduce year-to-year variation in revenue and hence financial risk. However, catch share programs may create more security and stability in vessels' landings, which may offset effects of less diversification. Nevertheless, there may be a tradeoff between the efficiency gains enabled by restricting access and risk-reduction benefits associated with greater diversification.},

  abstract = {Temperature variation within a year can impact biological processes driving population abundances. The implications for the ecosystem services these populations provide, including food production from marine fisheries, are poorly understood. Whether and how temperature variability impacts fishery yields may depend on the number of harvested species and differences in their responses to varying temperatures. Drawing from previous theoretical and empirical studies, we predict that greater temperature variability within years will reduce yields, but harvesting a larger number of species, especially a more functionally diverse set, will decrease this impact. Using a global marine fisheries dataset, we find that within-year temperature variability reduces yields, but current levels of functional diversity (FD) of targeted species, measured using traits related to species' responses to temperature, largely offset this effect. Globally, high FD of catch could avoid annual losses in yield of 6.8\% relative to projections if FD were degraded to the lowest level observed in the data. By contrast, species richness in the catch and in the ecosystem did not provide a similar mitigating effect. This work provides novel empirical evidence that short-term temperature variability can negatively impact the provisioning of ecosystem services, but that FD can buffer these negative impacts.},

The objective of this study is to summarize risk management practices in use in fisheries and to present strategies that are not currently used but may be applicable. Available tools originate from a variety of disciplines and are as diverse as the risks they address, including algorithms to aid in making decisions with multiple stakeholders, reserves to buffer against economic or biological surprises, and insurance instruments to help fishermen cope with economic variability. Techniques are organized in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, risks are identified and analysed. Strategies presented in this category focus on decision analysis, including multicriteria decision-making tools, and the related concept of risk assessment. Then in the treatment stage, identified risks can be transferred, avoided, or retained using tools such as the Precautionary Approach, portfolio management, financial contracts to manage price risk and horizontal integration. Published fishery applications are reviewed, and some empirical examples of risks and risk management using US fisheries data are presented.},

  abstract = {Among other foci, recent research on adaptation to climatic variability and change has sought to evaluate the merit of adaptation generally, as well as the suitability of particular adaptations. Additionally, there is a need to better understand the likely uptake of adaptations. For example, diversification is one adaptation that has been identified as a potential farm-level response to climatic variability and change, but its adoption by farmers for this reason is not well understood. This paper serves two purposes. The first is to document the adoption of crop diversification in Canadian prairie agriculture for the period 1994\textendash{}2002, reflect upon its strengths and limitations for managing a variety of risks, including climatic ones, and gauge its likely adoption by producers in response to anticipated climate change. The second purpose is to draw on this case to refine our current understanding of climate change adaptation more generally. Based upon data from over 15 000 operations, it was determined that individual farms have become more specialized in their cropping patterns since 1994, and this trend is unlikely to change in the immediate future, notwithstanding anticipated climate change and the known risk-reducing benefits of crop diversification. More broadly, the analysis suggests that `suitable' and even `possible' climate change adaptations need to be more rigorously assessed in order to understand their wider strengths and limitations.},

We obtain clear results on the extent to which the smoothness of f influences best rates of convergence for estimating g. For example, in nonparametric regression with two derivatives on g, `classical' rates of convergence are possible if and only if the unknown f satisfies a Lipschitz condition of order 1/3 or more. If a parametric model is known for g, then g may be estimated n\textsuperscript{1/2} consistently if and only if f is Lipschitz of order 1/2 or more. Optimal rates of convergence are attained by Kernel estimators.},

  abstract = {{Managing fish stocks in terms of a portfolio of economic assets is likely to significantly increase benefits for society relative to single-species approaches. A portfolio framework systematically combines fish stocks that are joined by ecology (e.g., predation, competition) and unspecialized fishing technologies (e.g., mixed-species trawls) into a portfolio which balances expected aggregate returns against the risks associated with stock-attribute and other uncertainties. To be productive, however, this framework must be combined with property rights institutions that clearly state management objectives, create long-run time-horizons among harvesters, internalize spillovers caused by ecological and technological jointness, and reduce uncertainty through research and adaptive management. Although the cost of reducing scientific uncertainty about ecological interactions may limit the portfolio approach to intensive management of relatively few species, its scope can be broadened to integrate tradeoffs among more types of marine resources, such as nature preserves and oil and gas deposits.}},

We adapt financial portfolio theory as a method for EBFM that accounts for species interdependencies, uncertainty, and sustainability constraints. Illustrating our method with routinely collected data available from the Chesapeake Bay, we demonstrate the gains from taking into account variances and covariances of gross fishing revenues in setting species total allowable catches. We find over the period from 1962-2003 that managers could have increased the revenues from fishing and reduced the variance by employing EBFM frontiers in setting catch levels.

  issn = {0962-8436, 1471-2970},
  doi = {10.1098/rstb.2005.1745},
  abstract = {Dynamic interactions between and within the biogeophysical and human environments lead to the production, processing, distribution, preparation and consumption of food, resulting in food systems that underpin food security. Food systems encompass food availability (production, distribution and exchange), food access (affordability, allocation and preference) and food utilization (nutritional and societal values and safety), so that food security is, therefore, diminished when food systems are stressed. Such stresses may be induced by a range of factors in addition to climate change and/or other agents of environmental change (e.g. conflict, HIV/AIDS) and may be particularly severe when these factors act in combination. Urbanization and globalization are causing rapid changes to food systems.
Climate change may affect food systems in several ways ranging from direct effects on crop production (e.g. changes in rainfall leading to drought or flooding, or warmer or cooler temperatures leading to changes in the length of growing season), to changes in markets, food prices and supply chain infrastructure. The relative importance of climate change for food security differs between regions. For example, in southern Africa, climate is among the most frequently cited drivers of food insecurity because it acts both as an underlying, ongoing issue and as a short-lived shock. The low ability to cope with shocks and to mitigate long-term stresses means that coping strategies that might be available in other regions are unavailable or inappropriate. In other regions, though, such as parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain of India, other drivers, such as labour issues and the availability and quality of ground water for irrigation, rank higher than the direct effects of climate change as factors influencing food security.
Because of the multiple socio-economic and bio-physical factors affecting food systems and hence food security, the capacity to adapt food systems to reduce their vulnerability to climate change is not uniform. Improved systems of food production, food distribution and economic access may all contribute to food systems adapted to cope with climate change, but in adopting such changes it will be important to ensure that they contribute to sustainability. Agriculture is a major contributor of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), so that regionally derived policies promoting adapted food systems need to mitigate further climate change.},

  abstract = {Catch-pooling cooperatives are a strategy for fishers to manage variability which can be organized independently of a central management agency. We examined the statistical properties of equal-share catch-pooling cooperatives, and tested their potential to mitigate risk using data from two Bering Sea crab fisheries prior to rationalization. The results suggest that small cooperatives of crabbers could have reduced vessel-level catch risk by as much as 40% in the red king crab fishery, but would have been ineffective in the snow crab fishery. Analytical examination of catch variances under cooperatives explains the discrepancy between the two fisheries and demonstrates that variability reduction depends on the degree of correlation amongst participants' catches. In the best-case scenario, catch-pooling cooperatives can diversify away all season to season variation resulting from individuals' luck and skill, leaving only variation in fishery-wide harvest.},

  title = {State of the world's fisheries},
  volume = {28},
  abstract = {▪ Abstract  The total world catch from marine and freshwater wild stocks has peaked and may be slightly declining. There appear to be few significant resources to be developed, and the majority of the world's fish stocks are intensively exploited. Many marine ecosystems have been profoundly changed by fishing and other human activities. Although most of the world's major fisheries continue to produce substantial sustainable yield, a number have been severely overfished, and many more stocks appear to be heading toward depletion. The world's fisheries continue to be heavily subsidized, which encourages overfishing and provides society with a small fraction of the potential economic benefits. In most of the world's fisheries there is a ``race for fish'' in which boats compete to catch the fish before a quota is achieved or the fish are caught by someone else. The race for fish leads to economic inefficiency, poor quality product, and pressure to extract every fish for short-term gain. A number of countries have instituted alternative management practices that eliminate the race for fish and encourage economic efficiency, use lower exploitation rates that deliberately do not attempt to maximize biological yield, and encourage reduced fishing costs and increased value of products. In fisheries where this transition has taken place, we see the potential for future sustainability, but in those fisheries where the race for fish continues, we anticipate further declines in abundance, further loss of jobs and fishing communities, and potential structural change to marine ecosystems.},

  abstract = {The optimal fishing pattern in a multi-cohort fishery is determined using risk theory. Portfolio theory becomes applicable by treating different age groups of fish as different assets. A possibility set is derived using data on Icelandic cod fisheries. In the presence of risk aversion, it is shown that the abrupt behavior found in deterministic models is changed towards a smoother fishing pattern. The historical selection pattern for the Icelandic cod stock is shown to be near optimal using a maximal effort-type cost function, but historical levels of effort are inefficient and lead to less profit and greater fluctuations than implied by profit or utility maximization.},

Changes in these behaviors predicted by an analytical model are evaluated against data from several fisheries. The predictions and the data suggest that a mix of specialist and generalist fishing behavior is a way of coping with unpredictability. Management usually regards fishing behavior as homogeneous; as a result, many management rules discriminate against one type of behavior or the other.},
