# Variability

1. For a given permit holder: NA (each permit holder has one CV value)

2. Across permit holders: 

- increased diversity = lower variability (somewhat quadratically for those including salmon in their strategy)
- longer fishing seasons = lower variability
- benefit of diversifying is much greater for those with longer fishing seasons 

3. Across strategies: 

- strategies with higher mean diversity may have very slightly higher CV (but this isn't as clear across most strategy groupings)
- strategies with higher mean diversity have more benefit to diversifying if salmon is included in the strategy 

# Revenue

1. For a given permit holder: 

- increased diversity = lower revenue
- longer boats make more money (obviously)s
- longer seasons = more money (obviously)
- no major interaction effects for these 3 predictors

2. Across permit holders:

- permit holders with higher mean diversity on average make slightly more money
- the variability around this relationship becomes tighter at higher levels of mean diversity
- not much change in the cost of diversifying across permit holders with different mean diversity levels

3. Across strategies:

- strategies with higher mean diversity on average make more money, especially if salmon are amongst the strategy 
- for some groupings, strategies with higher mean diversity have less of a diversifying cost (especially for salmon only, salmon plus crab, and salmon plus herring)
