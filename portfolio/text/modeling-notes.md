# Variability

Within permit holders - NA (we can't test this)
Across permit holders - increased diversity = lower variability (quadratic relationship)
Across strategies - increased diversity in some instances = higher variability
Across strategies - increase diversity in some instances = ?? in terms of benefit of diversifying

Note that this might be garbage because the quadratic term was centered first !!!!!

# Revenue

Within permit holders - increased diversity = lower revenue
Across permit holders - increased diversity = slightly higher revenue
Across permit holders - increased diversity = not much change in the benefit of diversifying
Across strategies - increased diversity = increased revenue
Across strategies - increased diversity = not much change in the benefit of diversify
