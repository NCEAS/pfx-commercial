## @holland2016 - The impact of access restrictions on fishery income diversification of US West Coast fishermen

vessels that entered West Coast fisheries less diversified than those that entered before IFQs (and of course cost is increased to get into these fisheries for those that were not already participants) @holland2016

diversification declined at a time following catch share programs on the West Coast @holland2016

catch share programs may reduce variability and offset the effects of lower diversity -- found that year-to-year vessel revenue decreased after catch shares (and average revenue increased for most) @holland2016

## @dymond2014 - Diversifying managed forests to increase resilience

diversity of planting in forestry can increase and stabilize revenue but especially if combined with removing high risk species (to pine beetle) initially @dymond2014

## @dymond2015 - Applying resilience concepts in forest management: a retrospective simulation approach

increasing forest diversity through reforestation increased resiliency to climate change, improved the stability and volume of timber and revenue from the timber @dymond2015

a meta-analysis 

"We found that high total [forest-related environmental income] income was associated with less income diversification, indicating that high-income communities specialize more." @vedeld2007

key reference of an example where wealthier communities were more specialized @vedeld2007

## @abdulai2001 *Determinants of income diversification amongst rural households in Southern Mali. Food Policy*

"We find evidence that poorer households have fewer opportunities in non-cropping activities such as livestock rearing and non-farm work, and hence less diversified incomes. This appears to reflect their relative lack of capital, which makes it difficult for them to diversify away from subsistence agriculture...  The significance of entry-constraints in explaining portfolio diversification suggests that the role of government in making assets — as well as improved infrastructure — available to poorer households is still essential in promoting income diversification." -  cited by 255 @abdulai2001

## @olale2012 - Determinants of income diversification among fishing communities in Western Kenya, Fisheries Research

"the study analyzes the determinants of income diversification decisions among the fishing communities, with a focus on those living on the Kenyan shores of Lake Victoria. The results show that education level, access to credit and membership of associations are the key factors that explain income diversification behaviour among fish workers." @olale2012

diversification here means into farm or other non-agricultural work @olale2012

access to financial capital important to diversification @olale2012

"Perhaps the most graphic, recent example of such risks was the reliance of U.S. crop producers on export markets for wheat, corn, and soybeans during the 1970s. Many farmers borrowed large sums of money to buy additional land and buy specialized equipment to supply these potentially profitable markets. @ikerd1990

Specialized farmers producing export commodities were hardest hit by the finan- cial crisis of American agriculture in the early 1980s. They had taken the risks associated with dependence on external inputs, including capital and labor-saving equipment in addition to chemical fertilizers and synthetic pesticides, to produce for markets that were vulnerable to an unpredictable world economy." @ikerd1990

high profitability and low variability of income from tobacco mean that the optimal farming strategy (regardless of risk profile) is to specialize as much as possible on tobacco (given alternatives such as soybean, alfalfa, chickpeas, ...) -- great reference to use -- quadratic optimization @chavez2014

a great review of the type and extent of farming diversification in North America @barbieri2008

those that were highly diversified tended to be younger @barbieri2008

diversification can happen in many ways such as through distribution, adding recreation or tourism or hospitality, consulting or education, ... @barbieri2008

size of farm was not related to level of diversity - for example, many small farms use diversification to maximize revenue given their limited land @barbieri2008

Introduction to special issue on income diversification and livelihoods in rural Africa @barrett2001

poor farmers face many barriers to diversifying due to the expense of initial investments -- diversification (including non-farm activities) positively correlated with income (on page 324 they cite a number of papers in the special issue with specific examples): "Block and Webb ﬁnd more income diversiﬁcation associated with higher welfare measured in both income and nutritional terms in Ethiopia, and that the least diversiﬁed ﬁght hard to increase their diversiﬁcation over time. Nonfarm income shares in peri-urban Tanzania rise sharply and monotonically with per capita food consumption quantiles according to Lanjouw et al. Barrett et al. report a strong association between greater income diversiﬁcation ˆ and higher wealth and income in Cote d’Ivoire and Kenya. Canagarajah et al. show that nonfarm earnings fuel increased income inequality in Uganda. The poor, unedu- cated, women, recent immigrants to a community, and others lacking social ties rarely enjoy the same access to remunerative opportunities as do educated males with strong social networks in the community." @barrett2001

nonfarm sources account for a substantial portion of average farm household income (40-45%) @barrett2001

they note that diversification is a form of self-insurance... but this should be stronger for poorer individuals but in fact it is stronger for richer individuals. so insurance isn't the only factor @barrett2001

another roll for diversification is to deal with shocks to income @barrett2001

entry barriers mean that poor farmers tend to be less diversified and are forced to experience lower returns and higher variability in earnings @barrett2001

"Greater physical access to market likewise consistently improves nonfarm earnings opportunities, as shown in Uganda by Smith et al. and in Tanzania by Lanjouw et al." @barrett2001

diversified income sources for those living in "forest margins" include "crop farming, off-farm employment, animal husbandry, home gardening, and extraction of nontimber forest products and fuel wood" @illukpitiya2008

overall, diversification was positively related with total income for those living in "forest margins" @illukpitiya2008

For example, in Indonesia, swidden agriculture is often used to buffer income in the face of rubber price fluctuations (Sulistiawati et al. 2005 in the special issue). An example of "subsistence farming and cash crop interaction" @mertz2005

## Mustapha, A. R. (1999). Cocoa farming and income diversification in South-western Nigeria.

Cocoa the most profitable crop export in Nigeria @mustapha1999

when cocoa prices were high, most cocoa farmers were highly specialized; now there is much more diversification to other sources of income... for example trading and electronic repairs @mustapha1999

"Historically, cocoa farmers rarely engaged in non-farm commercial or artisanal activities. When cocoa farmers took to non-farm occupations in the 1970s and 19803, it was as a result of the severe crisis of accumulation confronting them (Berry 1985). Indeed, only 5 per cent of the 1964 Alade sample had any non-farm occupation (Oloko 1964: 57). My 1992 study established that by the early 1980s, that is just before SAP, about 35 per cent of the Lower stratum in that survey, 30 per cent of the Middle, and 33 percent of the Upper had non‐farm occupations." @mustapha1999

"Portfolio management, whereby fishing enterprises have the ability to choose among a diverse portfolio of harvestable resources, would mitigate against the risk of fluctuations in the abundance, availability, or price of individual species." @hilborn2001

"Portfolio management seems a logical choice given that the overall productivity of fishery systems is more stable than individual species are." @hilborn2001

"Other examples are numerous. While the crab fisheries of Alaska collapsed, the salmon and groundfish fisheries blossomed. While chinook and coho salmon in British Columbia collapsed, sockeye, pink, and chum salmon did well." @hilborn2001

----------------

"Limited entry, which allows fishing time to be spread out, works against generalists, who gain advantage with shortened seasons.Seasons, especially shortened seasons, hurt the specialist because their catch effectiveness compared to the generalists reduced. Catch quotas have the same impact on specialists as seasons.The only difference is that quotas make it difficult to know the length of a season." @smith1986

"The hypothesis is that a multipurpose fishery composed of specialists and generalists is the best adaptation. The ratio of specialists to generalists is a function of the variability in the fishery, the capital costs of entering the fishery, and the costs of switching between fisheries." @smith1986
