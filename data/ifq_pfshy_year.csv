M06B,999,I don't think this is a catch share fishery - Misc longline statewide < 60' - no landings since 2005 have a catch share program listed

M6AB,999,"This one is kinda funky. There are a bunch of CDQ landings. And there are a few that are listed as IFQ. But most are listed as OA. Sooooo, I'm not sure what we want to call this. "
M7HB,2000,"This category includes both AFA and A80. We have removed all A80 boats and all AFA CPs so the only relevant year here for rationalization should be 1999. However, I think that not all landings in this category are rationalized"

K91R,NA,Historical code - not sure how to describe it - it doesn't have any NMFS management codes because it was defunct before the NMFS codes happened.
